# COMP0098_21049846
The master thesis project for COMP0098 MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning ProjectURL

This PyTorch code was used in the experiments of the thesis project:

The code is cleaned post-acceptance and may run into some errors. Although I did some quick check and saw the code ran fine, please create an issue if you encounter errors and I will try to fix them as soon as possible.

# Dataset
We used two different datasets: [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) (Krizhevsky, 2009), and [CIFAR10.2](https://github.com/modestyachts/cifar-10.2) (Lu et al., 2020).

# Running the code
## Step 0: set up a virtual environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate thesis_1
```
